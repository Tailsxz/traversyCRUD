{{!-- It is actually crazy and super cool that we can just use bring in these style sheets and just apply classes to our elements and end up with a good looking component --}}
{{!-- Upon inspecting it seems that the color and darken class are of a combined selector! So I am assuming materialize specifies darken classes for all of their colors --}}
