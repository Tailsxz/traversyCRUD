### Knowledge gained from this project
Learned how to use mongoose to be able to connect to MongoDB and apply schemas.
Found out there are definitely people connecting to my existing cluster as I forgot to make an old project private, which was using my dbConnection string directly in the server.js! Oops! Learned how to terminate a cluster.
